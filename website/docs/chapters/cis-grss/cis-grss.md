#### Topic: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and Potential Applications

Abstract : In the recent past, many areas of artificial Intelligence (AI) such as machine learning and deep learning have seen developments at a breakneck speed. Major IT firms are investing heavily in
these areas to gain a strategic advantage. This intense competition has resulted in many novel AI
technologies, which are being incorporated into a plethora of applications in a variety of domains.
This talk will provide an overview of the hype and reality behind the recent claims by the AI
community, and outline its potential use in a variety of domains. Deep learning techniques are
capable of making sense out of large volumes of disparate data, and (deep) reinforcement
learning can deal with complex control and planning scenarios. Therefore, in combination, these
techniques can be used to address many real world challenges.

### First Richard Moore Memorial Lecture by Dr. Paul A. Rosen, JPL, NASA and Fellow IEEE
#### Topic: Innovations in synthetic aperture radar: past, present and future  
Abstract :  The age ofspaceborne radar remote sensing was born in 1978 with the launch of SEASAT, an experimental satellite carry an array of microwave instruments − a radiometer, an altimeter, and a synthetic aperture radar. SEASAT demonstrated in its short lifespan theuniqueness and utility of radar’s all−weather day/night capabilities and led to a sustained and accelerating international growth in the number and variety of radar instrumentsthat are orbiting Earth and the planets. Unlike optical sensors, radarsees the electrical and structural properties of an object and therefore give us a view of worlds that is quite different from our everyday experience.
With wavelengthsthatspan a range from millimetersto kilometers, radars can scatterfrom ice crystals in clouds as well as penetrate deep into ice crusts of planetary objects. Spacefaring nations consider Earth imaging radar to be critical to theirscientific and operational needs, and a growing number of systems are being launched around the world. The volume of radar data being acquired of
Earth is growing rapidly as the benefits of continuous time−series around the globe are becoming apparent.  
Sophisticated techniques in change detection and quantitative geodesy using interferometric and polarimetric methods are revolutionizing the fields of solid earth science, glaciology, and ecosystems science, among others. Radar altimeters operationally measure ocean topography,mm−wavelength radarsounders profile cloud and precipitation, and scatterometers determine oceanwinds.  
These data are becoming essential climate records, with a scientific imperative for continuing measurements. With the availability of low−cost space−qualified digital hardware,radars are becomingmore flexible,more capable, and less expensive per unit area observed. Along with the standardization of cubesats and smallspacecraG, many companies are now planning dense constellations ofradarsatellites to feed the growing commercial market for radar imagery. In addition to facility−class missions are becoming more capable and flexible collecting petabytes of data each year. This will only grow in the future. In this talk, an overview of the major developments in spaceborne radar systems will be presented, highlighting the intersections of science and innovation in spaceborne radar developments, including some of the most interesting science and technology achievements obtained over the years, and describe
upcoming initiatives that support future directions in Earth and planetary observations.
